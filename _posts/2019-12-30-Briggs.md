Bad Arguments For Lockdowns & The Burden Of Proof.

The burden of proof that lockdowns work is clearly on those imposing and
supporting lockdowns. Lockdown skeptics are under no obligation
whatsoever to show lockdowns do not work.

Lockdowns are a burden, an imposition, a severe restriction of liberty.
It is certain and indisputable that they cause harm. Therefore, if
lockdown supporters cannot prove with something approaching certainty
they work, then lockdowns cannot and should not be imposed.
