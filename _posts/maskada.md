SACRAMENTO, Calif. â€”

If you have a condition or disability that prevents you from wearing a
face mask/covering, you might be wondering about your rights.

California health officials announced June 18 that people are required
to wear masks in most public settings, but there are some exceptions.
Those with a medical condition, mental health condition, or disability
that prevents wearing a face covering are exempt, according to guidance
from the California Department of Public Health.
