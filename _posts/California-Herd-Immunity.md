The hypothesis that COVID-19 first started spreading in California in
the fall of 2019 is one explanation for the state's lower than expected
case numbers.

As of Tuesday, the state had 374 reported COVID-19 fatalities in a state
of 40 million people, compared to New York which has seen 14 times as
many fatalities and has a population half that of California. Social
distancing could be playing a role but New York's stay-at-home order
went into effect on March 22, three days after California implemented
its order.

"Something is going on that we haven't quite found out yet," said Victor
Davis Hanson a senior fellow with Stanford's Hoover Institute.
