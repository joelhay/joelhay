So the US must have the worst health care in the world!

4.5% of world population 26% of Coronavirus cases and deaths!!!!! In
reality, since the more you test the more you find, these numbers are
meaningless!

BUT ALL PUBLIC HEALTH IDIOTS EXCEPT SWEDEN DON'T SEE THAT IT IS ONLY A
FUNCTION OF \# OF TESTS
