Like Sweden; South Dakota never locked down! and with only 21 deaths,
their death rate is 24 per million---ONE TENTH the US C19 mortality
rate.

Lockdowns don't work!!!

South Dakota Gov. Kristi Noem on Tuesday mapped out a plan for getting
the state “back to normal,” amid the coronavirus outbreak, a plan that
she said emphasizes personal responsibility instead of government
orders.

Later, the Republican governor – who drew criticism from Democrats and
others for never issuing a statewide stay-at-home-order -- talked about
her plan “In South Dakota we didn’t close any businesses. We didn’t do
any shelter-in-place.”
