USC and the Los Angeles County Department of Public Health (Public
Health) today released preliminary results from a collaborative
scientific study that suggests infections from the new coronavirus are
far more widespread - and the fatality rate much lower - in L.A. County
than previously thought. Based on results of the first round of testing,
the research team estimates that approximately 4.1% of the county’s
adult population has antibody to the virus. Adjusting this estimate for
statistical margin of error implies about 2.8% to 5.6% of the county’s
adult population has antibody to the virus- which translates to
approximately 221,000 to 442,000 adults in the county who have had the
infection. That estimate is 28 to 55 times higher than the 7,994
confirmed cases of COVID-19 reported to the county by the time of the
study in early April. The number of COVID-related deaths in the county
has now surpassed 600.
