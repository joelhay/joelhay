Let's compare C19 vs the Hong Kong flu pandemic which had 1-4 million
deaths.

HK flu was a global outbreak of influenza that originated in China in
July 1968 and lasted until 1969â€“70 and infected more than 15% of the US
population (\>30 million HK flu cases). No lockdowns anywhere! Hardly
even discussed in the media.

Compare that to Covid-19.

Even if you believe the highly upwardly biased numbers for C19:

0.5 million C19 deaths vs 1-4 million HK flu deaths

2.3 million C19 cases vs 30+million HK flu cases.

And the reality is that CDC Excess Deaths are net negative despite C19!

Does anyone see any overreaction here?
