Here is the key pg 3 paragraph from the IHME/Gates modeling paper for
why we’re all in lockdown. Notice that there is NOT ONE REFERENCE TO
SUPPORT SOCIAL DISTANCING??

And notice that the “treatment effects” of social isolation controls
(SICs) is totally arbitrary?

-   They say do one SIC you get a 33% reduction

-   do two SICs you get a 67% reduction

-   do 3-4 SICs you get a 100% reduction

We should have had zero C19 transmission by now and zero cases according
to this!

they say all SICs are interchangeable! School closures, restaurant, bar
and other “non-essential” business closures, stay at home lockdowns, and
transportation closures, ARE ALL IDENTICAL AND EQUIVALENT in their
effects on C19 transmission. I thought we have already done all four for
about 30 days? Why isn’t C19 transmission zero?

So we’re in lockdown based on ZERO EVIDENCE!!!

Not to mention that this model keeps changing daily. And they are
forecasting double the US deaths and a wider confidence interval than
they did before imposing SICs on the US!

I thought SICs were supposed to reduce cases and deaths, not increase
them!
