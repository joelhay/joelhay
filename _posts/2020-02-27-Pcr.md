Here are links to two very important articles about PCR testing. The
verdict - it sucks for Corona Testing.

[*“PCR basically takes a sample of your cells and amplifies any DNA to
look for ‘viral sequences’, i.e. bits of non-human DNA that seem to
match parts of a known viral genome. The problem

It uses ‘amplification’ which means taking a very very tiny amount of
DNA and growing it exponentially until it can be analysed. Obviously any
minute contaminations in the sample will also be amplified leading to
potentially gross errors of discovery. Additionally, it’s only looking
for partial viral sequences, not whole genomes, so identifying a single
pathogen is next to impossible even if you ignore the other
issues.*](https://www.google.com/url?q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.weblyf.com%2F2020%2F05%2Fcoronavirus-the-truth-about-pcr-test-kit-from-the-inventor-and-other-experts%2F&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AFQjCNEhHerTxOWJIZ8WW4DAUI9lLu2UpQ)[***The
