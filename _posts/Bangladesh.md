If anyone thinks that lockdowns are meaningful in a country like
Bangladesh, they are very naive. Nevertheless, Bangladesh released its
lockdowns of many vital apparel factories 2 weeks ago! Did they get
millions of new cases and deaths?

No! Bangladeshi C19 death rate is 1/20 the US reported rate! 161
milliion Bangladeshis living in some of the most crowded conditions in
the world. Only 228 deaths through May10! Even safer than US prisons!

There is no evidence in extremely dense countries that can NEVER do real
lockdowns like Bangladesh and India that millions are dying from C19 --
and they never will. Lockdowns were always meaningless when you can
reach out your window and touch your neighbors!
