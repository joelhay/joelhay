It is actually the NPR reporters on this story that have intellectual disabilities. We call this C19 Derangement Syndrome.

While telling us that those in group living for intellectual disabilities have among the very highest C19 death rates, ostensibly because they're packed together like sardines, and can't socially distance, NPR blithely ignores the fact that out of 2.3 million US prisoners, who are also packed together like sardines and are 90%+ postive for C19, there have been only 496 C19 deaths thus far! 1/2 the death rate of the unconstitutionally locked down civilians!

If C19 kills relatively more of one group of densely packed institutional residents because they can't social distance, why doesn't it kill all of them? No one is more densely packed than prisoners!
