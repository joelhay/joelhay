The Telegraph - Why have so many coronavirus patients died in Italy?

There is clear evidence of massive Italian C19 death inflation: This
will affect our peak level forecasts but not our inflection point
estimates.

Again, this will change the reporting levels relative to Asia, but
probably won’t change the dynamics of the Italian epidemic very much.
Compared to Asia and other EU counties (e.g. Sweden and Norway) the
death overcount in Italy may be 8-fold:

But Prof Ricciardi added that Italy’s death rate may also appear high
because of how doctors record fatalities. “The way in which we code
deaths in our country is very generous in the sense that all the people
who die in hospitals with the coronavirus are deemed to be dying of the
coronavirus. “On re-evaluation by the National Institute of Health, only
12 per cent of death certificates have shown a direct causality from
coronavirus, while 88 per cent of patients who have died have at least
one pre-morbidity - many had two or three,” he says.
