Between March 22 and April 4, 2020, a total of 215 pregnant women
delivered infants at the New Yorkâ€“Presbyterian Allen Hospital and
Columbia University Irving Medical Center . All the women were screened
on admission for symptoms of Covid-19. Four women (1.9%) had fever or
other symptoms of Covid-19 on admission, and all 4 women tested positive
for SARS-CoV-2 (Figure 1). Of the 211 women without symptoms, all were
afebrile on admission. Nasopharyngeal swabs were obtained from 210 of
the 211 women (99.5%) who did not have symptoms of Covid-19; of these
women, 29 (13.7%) were positive for SARS-CoV-2. Thus, 29 of the 33
patients who were positive for SARS-CoV-2 at admission (87.9%) had no
symptoms of Covid-19 at presentation.
