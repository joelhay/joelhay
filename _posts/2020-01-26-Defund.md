The WHO should definitely be defunded!

Why would they even be telling us that asymptomatics can't transmit C19? Locking down asymptomatics was the whole point of the lockdowns! So we went through this lockdown disaster and cratered the global economy for nothing?!!!!!


Not knowing whether asymptomatics can transmit C19 this many months into the pandemic, much less the lockdowns? Why don't the asymptomatics at the WHO cross-inject their colleagues with C19 and show that nothing
happens! If they don't want to use WHO officials as lab rats, they could even use lab rats!

Not knowing whether asymptomatics can transmit C19 would be like a major league batter not knowing 3 strikes and you're out! WHO can't even play whiffleball!
