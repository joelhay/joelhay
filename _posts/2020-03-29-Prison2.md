Only 304 US prisoner deaths through May 6, although prisoners locked up
like sardines!

2.3 million US prisoners 80%+ C19 positive!!!

US prisoner death rate still ½ the US civilian unconstitutional lockdown
C19 death rate.

WHY AREN’T PRISONERS DYING LIKE CRAZY?

Because C19 doesn’t kill young and healthy without pre-existing risks
and comorbidities.

Lockdowns don't work.
