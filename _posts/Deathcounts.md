For the average American under age 55 the death risk from C19 is less
that the risk of dying from commuting to work for 4 weeks! For those
55-64 the death risk from C19 is about the same as commuting to work for
two months. I'll bet any of the 30 million Americans just thrown out of
work by the lockdowns would take that risk in a heartbeat if they could
have their job!

\

So far according to the CDC there have been only 9 C19 deaths reported
in the whole country under the age of 25. Yet schools and colleges still
shut.

\

Let the young and healthy practice herd immunity! It works in Sweden and
even in US prisons.
