We see a lot of these stories, they end a lockdown and instantly cases
and deaths soar!

Isn't it amazing that the C19 virus is so smart that the day Bangladesh
reopened the economy there were sharp spikes in cases and 40 new deaths!
The virus was so clever it didn't even wait 5 days to cause symptoms or
30 days to kill these newly unlocked victims the day the lockdown was
released!

The obvious alternative explanation is that nervous medical coders
rushed a bunch of alarmists case and death reports for political
reasons.

And Bangladesh's C19 reported death rate is 100 times lower than the US,
and they've reopened! Social isolation in Bangladesh is a silly fiction
anyway!
