"the R" is notoriously difficult to pin down and the UK has not been
issuing estimates. But Imperial also applied its UK assumptions to
Sweden, warning that its rejection of lockdown was likely to leave the
virus rampant with an R of between 3 and 4. That is to say: every person
infected would give it to three or four others. Its modelling envisaged
Sweden paying a heavy price for its rejection of lockdown, with 40,000
Covid deaths by 1 May and almost 100,000 by June.

The latest figure for Sweden is 2,680 deaths, with daily deaths peaking
a fortnight ago.
