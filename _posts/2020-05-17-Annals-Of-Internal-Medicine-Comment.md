Lauer et al. report the infection rates of COVID-19, with a median
incubation time of 5.1 days (95% CI: 4.5-5.8). Though COVID-19 has been
declared a global pandemic, social distancing measures to reduce
infections will likely have a far greater cost in economic productivity
and welfare than this virus will. Extreme, hasty lockdown measures in
several countries (e.g. United States, Italy, and China) have
effectively halted global, regional, and local economies. Officials have
attributed the slowing epidemic in China and elsewhere to such lockdown
measures; yet in South Korea, where widespread testing has been most
successfully implemented, cases have slowed through traditional
case-contact tracing rather than social distancing, which is not
effective unless implemented immediately and aggressively.

We estimated country-specific logistic growth curves as functions of
time from Day Zero (when the cumulative number of reported cases
surpasses 100)2 using linear models and ridge regression with
leave-one-out cross-validation, estimating Hubei Province separately
from the rest of China. Cumulative case curves are similarly shaped
among all countries with growth rates lying between those for Hubei and
South Korea. While case and fatality reporting in different countries
may be subject to differential reporting biases, they are unlikely
time-varying. All countries reporting cases 25+ days after Day Zero have
demonstrated rapid declines in new cases by Day 25, with growth rates in
all countries declining by Day 15.

Each 1% increase in unemployment corresponds to \~4000 additional deaths
per year. Based on these curves, global cumulative cases are unlikely to
exceed 500,000 or deaths 50,000, regardless of measures taken. Financial
markets have lost \>\$15 trillion, resulting in more lives lost from
panic and economic disruption than gained from social distancing and
economy shutdown, at a cost of \~\$300 million per life.
