Here’s the fundamental question that no one seems to have asked; what is
the mechanism of action whereby C19 attacks the body and kills people?

We know what it is for other deadly viruses, like HIV, Smallpox, Swine
Flu, Hep C, Hep B, Herpes, etc. but the MDs and virologists are
strangely silent about the C19 mechanism of action. See if anyone can
tell you. When I ask my clinician friends they have no clue. Presumably
it is a random cytokine storm that overwhelms the immune system, but
where is this written up and is it consistent with every case?

Furthermore, “cytokine storms” are particularly problematic, since they
can be caused by many many things, particularly in frail,
immunocompromised patients with exactly the comorbidities associated
with C19. So having a “cytokine storm” as the proximate cause doesn’t at
all address whether C19 is a root cause.

How does this pathogen cause pathology?

Koch’s postulates have not even been systematically evaluated on C19 and
yet we slammed everyone into lockdowns?
