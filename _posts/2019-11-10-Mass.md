**A THIRD of participants in Massachusetts study test positive for
antibodies linked to COVID-19 after giving their blood samples in the
street at random**

-   **Study was done by physicians at the Massachusetts General Hospital
    in Chelsea**

-   **They collected blood from 200 people in Bellingham Square this
    week**

-   **One third of study participants - or 64 people - had COVID-19
    antibodies**

-   **Results indicate that participants previously had COVID-19**

-   **None of the 200 participants received test results due to
    anonymity**

-   **Chelsea had the highest rate of COVID-19 cases in the state**

-   **Physicians hope to place a medical tent outside the Mass. General
    Chelsea Healthcare Center to conduct more antibodies test**
