The Washington Times: Public policy panic about the COVID-19 pandemic
not supported by the facts.

Politicians and medical experts assert that: 1) COVID-19 is lethal to
many beyond those that typically succumb to pneumonia in flu season
(typically up to 60,000 in the United States annually; and 2) COVID-19
is still slowly spreading in major industrialized countries, implying
there is still some potential benefit to the enormously costly social
distancing and economic shutdown measures.

What if they are wrong? What if COVID-19 isnâ€™t significantly deadlier
than regular flu? What if COVID-19 has already spread everywhere
possible? Are we engaged in the most expensive public health
intervention in history without any possible payback?
