Only 17% of the patients were working, compared with 37% who were
retired and 46% who were unemployed, the survey said. Sixty-six percent
of patients said they were at home before they were admitted to the
hospital, compared with 18% who had been in nursing homes, 4% from
assisted-living facilities and less than 1% from prisons.

“This is a surprise,” Mr. Cuomo said. “We were thinking that maybe we
were going to find a higher percentage of essential employees who were
getting sick because they were going to work—that these may be nurses,
doctors, transit workers. That’s not the case, and they were
predominately at home.”
