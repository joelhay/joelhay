How about New Jersey?

Another state where health care workers, panicked by hysterical fear,
killed thousands of mostly nursing home residents 2-8 weeks earlier than
they would have died by shoving ventillators down their throats and
other deadly medical errors (happy to provide video proof). Even Jersey
is seeing the same 60% reduction in ALL CAUSE mortality in July as
everywhere else in the USA.

\

Washington State Deaths are also down 60%!!!!

Be happy go out and celebrate outside!]WA is ALARMIST GROUND ZERO!!!
Bill Gates, Washington State and the infamous stupid IHME model that
locked us all down based on ZERO actual evidence. Guess what folks you
can lock us up, but cases still skyrocket and deaths still plummet! Just
like everywhere else in the USA.

OK; so let's keep doing the Alarmist states. Yes Illinois, cases are up,
BUT DEATHS ARE WAY WAY DOWN. PCR tests are BS!! Be happy, deaths are
down 60% in IL, just like in the rest of America. Why are you locked
down in IL?

\

And in Georgia, where the Governor actually wants people to live, work
and enjoy their lives the Alarmists are having fits because people
aren't burying themselve under their beds.

\

But deaths are way down in GA! Be happy! They are down over 60% just
like everywhere else. And now in July we are starting to see the
blackpoints below the 5 year trends, not just the hollow points!
