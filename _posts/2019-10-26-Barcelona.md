On [joelhay.com](joelhay.com)I've been saying that from Day One of the C19 pandemic (first 100 cases
or 10 deaths) that it was EVERYWHERE!!!! The globe was SEROSATURATED!!!!

Now we're back to March, 2019 with C19 guys!

What good is a lockdown of a fastmoving airborne virus (novel at that) an entire year after the virus?????
