First of all, without T-cell tests (which don't yet exist) we don't know if 90%+ of people exposed to C19 don't have symptoms. Very few kids got sick at all from C19 and less than 20 US deaths under age 15.

So how does C19 give 35% of patients no symptoms? Because, as I've been saying all along, the virus was fully saturated in the global population months ago
