Where is any evidence that SICs work when they are started 2 weeks into
the C19 PCR+ case reporting? We know that by March 3, 2020, which is the
day that the US hit 100 PCR+ cases, there had to be many many people
already exposed and successfully suppressing virus. The asymptomatic
transmission had already occured in every state!

What are the justificaitons for SICs? All of it is post hoc
justification. There is NO EVIDENCE that SICs work, particularly when
implemented 2 weeks into the actual C19 PCR+ epidemic of sick and frail
people reporting to ICUs. By then the cat is out of the bag.

And by the way, since Tigers can get C19, what about cats? Do we need to
lock down all house pets?

The antibody tests will answer that question in Santa Clara County in a
couple weeks.
