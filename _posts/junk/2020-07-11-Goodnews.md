Again, great news! The daily global reported C19 death rate keeps
falling while countries keep ending social distancing restrictions.
Cases continue to climb, but deaths continue to fall. The alarmists will
never be able to explain that, but it is very simple; Cases are a
function of tests; the more you test the more you find. As I've been
saying from the beginning at [joelhay.com](joelhay.com) this virus was fully saturated globally long before the lockdowns started in March.
