Why are we not taking care of the people in nursing homes who need
isolation, since they are 150 times more likely to die with C19?

Locking down schools when only 51 people under age 25 have died from
C19? And nearly all US prisoners are C19 positive, but are young and
healthy and die at 1/2 the US rate (which is nursing home deaths to a
large extent).
