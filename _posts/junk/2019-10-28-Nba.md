NBA athletes, crammed together like sardines until they stopped playing
on March 11,2020.

So there have been two months since they self-isolated. Plenty of time
to develop C19 symptoms.

Looks like no athletes have dropped dead yet. And no one in their
families has either.

Why can't we watch the NBA or any sports played by people under age 55
and healthy? They have a higher risk driving to the stadium for 2
months.
