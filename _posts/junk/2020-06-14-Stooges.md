Why won't Trump fire the Three Stooges (Fauci, Redfield and Birx)?

How often have they even bothered to point out how silly contact tracing
is, given the enormous number of false positives on the C19 PCR test!

This is an excellent piece on how crappy the PCR viral load tests are.
And to think that is the entire basis of this utterly ridiculous
nonsense on trying to “contact trace.” I do know whether to laugh or
cry. I have to do both for this.
