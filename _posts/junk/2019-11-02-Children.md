Is anyone surprised that kids are the biggest victims of the useless
lockdowns?

The real tragedy: kids did not have to suffer food insecurity and
starvation. Or the attendant struggles by the powerless to get food from
those with power. "Oh government will take care of that!" The same
government that told us C19 transmissions would be zero by May! WE JUST
TOPPED 100,000 US C19 REPORTED DEATHS.
