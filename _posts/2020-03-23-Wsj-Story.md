[The WSJ story on Stanford study is now
up](https://www.google.com/url?q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.wsj.com%2Farticles%2Fnew-data-suggest-the-coronavirus-isnt-as-deadly-as-we-thought-11587155298%3Fmod%3Dopinion_lead_pos5&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AFQjCNGF46R-nHUfR1jm0rpZ3ojmt-3vDg)

"The researchers found that the percentage of infections was indeed
vastly larger than the roughly 1,000 known positive cases in the county
at the time of the study.... 50 to 85 times as high as the number of
known cases.

the large majority of people who contract Covid-19 recover without ever
knowing they were infected, and that the U.S. infection fatality rate
may be more than an order of magnitude lower than authorities had
assumed. ... true infection fatality rate is somewhere in the range of
0.12% to 0.2%—far closer to seasonal influenza.

A study published in the New England Journal of Medicine examined 215
women entering two hospitals to give birth between March 22 and April 4.
These patients had a Covid-19 infection rate over 15%. Of expectant
mothers who tested positive for active infections, 88% were asymptomatic
at the time of admission. ... infection rate 10 times the rate of known
cases in the city as a whole as of April 17—and New Yorkers have been
tested for Covid-19 far more extensively than residents of other
states."
