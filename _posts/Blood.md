### **WHY TEST STORED BLOOD SAMPLES?**

Evidence is mounting that suggests COVID-19 was present on US soil as
early as November

Stored samples of blood from September 2019 on **can and should** be
tested with antibody assays that will indicate the presence of viral
antibodies long before lockdowns were implemented. If antibodies are
present then this is indisputable proof that COVID-19 was already
rampant in the population in 2019.

COVID19 is very similar to the SARS virus that caused the 2003 outbreak
and other coronaviruses. Scientists have been working on vaccines and
therapy for SARS since 2003 without success, so staying in lockdown
until a Covid-19 vaccine is developed is not a feasible option

Viral load tests (PCR) and serology tests (antibodies) are currently
available, although both types of tests have false negatives and false
positives.

Existing tests cannot tell you definitively whether youâ€™ve been exposed
to the C19 virus. New experimental T-cell tests find many asymptomatic
people who do not test positive on antibody or viral tests. **Such tests
are not FDA-approved for general use**.

**No antibody test is FDA-approved for clinical diagnostic use.**
