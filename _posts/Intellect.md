It is actually the NPR reporters on this story that have intellectual
disabilities. We call this C19 Derangement Syndrome.

\

While telling us that those in group living for intellectual
disabilities have among the very highest C19 death rates, ostensibly
because they're packed together like sardines, and can't socially
distance, NPR blithely ignores the fact that out of 2.3 million US
prisoners, who are also packed together like sardines and are 90%+
postive for C19, there have been only 496 C19 deaths thus far! 1/2 the
death rate of the unconstitutionally locked down civilians!

\

If C19 kills relatively more of one group of densely packed
institutional residents because they can't social distance, why doesn't
it kill all of them? No one is more densely packed than prisoners!
