Good to be in Prof. Ioannidis company on this.

It was clear in February that C19 isn't worse than typical flu.

\

Consider John Ioannidis, a professor at Stanford’s School of Medicine.
He juggles appointments in statistics, biomedical data, prevention
research and health research and policy. Google Scholar ranks him among
the world’s 100 most-cited scientists. Yet he’s now found himself
pilloried because he dissents from the theories behind the
lockdowns—because he’s looked at the data and found good news.

In a March article for Stat News, Dr. Ioannidis argued that Covid-19 is
far less deadly than modelers were assuming. He considered the
experience of the Diamond Princess cruise ship, which was quarantined
Feb. 4 in Japan. Nine of 700 infected passengers and crew died. Based on
the demographics of the ship’s population, Dr. Ioannidis estimated that
the U.S. fatality rate could be as low as 0.025% to 0.625% and put the
upper bound at 0.05% to 1%—comparable to that of seasonal flu.

“If that is the true rate,” he wrote, “locking down the world with
potentially tremendous social and financial consequences may be totally
irrational.
