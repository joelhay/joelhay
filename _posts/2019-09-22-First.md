Remember the 1st Amendment to the US Constitution? 
--------------------------------------------------

Isn't that a SIC joke? "no law... abridging the right of the
people peaceably to assemble..."

When does this fake emergency bow to the US Constitution rather than
following the whims of the irresponsible alarmists who are claiming
authority.

Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or
prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or abridging the freedom of
speech, or of the press; or the right of the people peaceably to
assemble, and to petition the government for a redress of grievances.
