So we are 44 days into the US epidemic, and 30 days since the mandatory
Social Isolation Control (SIC) lockdowns. All 2.3 million US prisoners
are all locked down and cannot do and have not done social distancing,
and yet only 32 deaths? Maybe mandatory social mixing is much better
than mandatory social isolation!

At least 1,324 confirmed coronavirus cases are tied to prisons and jails
across the United States, according to data tracked by The Times,
including at least 32 deaths.
