Key Points

Question Among patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), is
there an association between use of hydroxychloroquine, with or without
azithromycin, and in-hospital mortality?

Findings In a retrospective cohort study of 1438 patients hospitalized
in metropolitan New York, compared with treatment with neither drug, the
adjusted hazard ratio for in-hospital mortality for treatment with
hydroxychloroquine alone was 1.08, for azithromycin alone was 0.56, and
for combined hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin was 1.35. None of these
hazard ratios were statistically significant.

Meaning Among patients hospitalized with COVID-19, treatment with
hydroxychloroquine, azithromycin, or both was not associated with
significantly lower in-hospital mortality.
