<p>Published March 20th</p>

<p>Lauer et al. report the infection rates of COVID-19, with a median incubation time of 5.1 days (95% CI: 4.5-5.8). Though COVID-19 has been declared a global pandemic, social distancing measures to reduce infections will likely have a far greater cost in economic productivity and welfare than this virus will. Extreme, hasty lockdown measures in several countries (e.g. United States, Italy, and China) have effectively halted global, regional, and local economies. Officials have attributed the slowing epidemic in China and elsewhere to such lockdown measures; yet in South Korea, where widespread testing has been most successfully implemented, cases have slowed through traditional case-contact tracing rather than social distancing, which is not effective unless implemented immediately and aggressively.</p>

<p>We estimated country-specific logistic growth curves as functions of time from Day Zero (when the cumulative number of reported cases surpasses 100)2 using linear models and ridge regression with leave-one-out cross-validation, estimating Hubei Province separately from the rest of China. Cumulative case curves are similarly shaped among all countries with growth rates lying between those for Hubei and South Korea. While case and fatality reporting in different countries may be subject to differential reporting biases, they are unlikely time-varying. All countries reporting cases 25+ days after Day Zero have demonstrated rapid declines in new cases by Day 25, with growth rates in all countries declining by Day 15. (https://rpubs.com/nzawadzki/covid19-by-country, https://drive.google.com/file/d/1LX2IamvOebtg7Xan9nIvKJ-zVAqbVQlr/view?usp=sharing).</p>

<p>Each 1% increase in unemployment corresponds to ~4000 additional deaths per year. Based on these curves, global cumulative cases are unlikely to exceed 500,000 or deaths 50,000, regardless of measures taken. Financial markets have lost &gt;$15 trillion, resulting in more lives lost from panic and economic disruption than gained from social distancing and economy shutdown, at a cost of ~$300 million per life.</p>
