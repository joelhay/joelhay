                </li>
                Here’s the fundamental question that no one seems to have asked; what is the mechanism of action whereby C19 attacks the body and kills people? We know what it is for other deadly viruses, like HIV, Smallpox, Swine Flu, Hep C, Hep B, Herpes, etc. but the MDs and virologists are strangely silent about the C19 mechanism of action. See if anyone can tell you. When I ask my clinician friends they have no clue....<br>

                I’m still projecting more than 100 lockdown deaths for every C19 death avoided through lockdowns! Anyone could have foreseen that the economic and health consequences of the lockdowns were going to be severe and fatal. The worst thing about the Ferguson ICL model and the Gates/IHME model is not that they missed the actual impacts by literally orders of magnitude, but that they considered NONE of the costs of the lockdown and social isolation policies....<br>

How do the alarmist idiots deal with a total collapse of the C19 testing data systems. Many people are testing positive without even completing a test!!!!!

Concerns arise as some receive positive COVID-19 results but never got tested

If so many people have been incorrectly identified as positive in the state’s system so easily, how accurate are the numbers that are released daily?

                Good to be in Prof. Ioannidis company on this. It was clear in February that C19 isn’t worse than typical flu. Consider John Ioannidis, a professor at Stanford’s School of Medicine. He juggles appointments in statistics, biomedical data, prevention research and health research and policy. Google Scholar ranks him among the world’s 100 most-cited scientists. Yet he’s now found himself pilloried because he dissents from the theories behind the lockdowns—because he’s looked at the data...<br>

                Look at Caifornia, Texas and Florida.

Repeat after me: Don’t look at C19 cases (most are totally
asymptomatic). FLORIDA ALL CAUSE DEATHS PLUMMETED IN JULY!!! Normally
the NY Times and social media would be all over a good news story like
all-cause deaths down 60%!

                Again, great news! The daily global reported C19 death rate keeps falling while countries keep ending social distancing restrictions. Cases continue to climb, but deaths continue to fall. The alarmists will never be able to explain that, but it is very simple; Cases are a function of tests; the more you test the more you find. As I’ve been saying from the beginning at joelhay.com this virus was fully saturated globally long before the lockdowns...<br>

                For the average American under age 55 the death risk from C19 is less that the risk of dying from commuting to work for 4 weeks! For those 55-64 the death risk from C19 is about the same as commuting to work for two months. I’ll bet any of the 30 million Americans just thrown out of work by the lockdowns would take that risk in a heartbeat if they could have their job! So...<br>

                Let’s compare C19 vs the Hong Kong flu pandemic which had 1-4 million deaths. HK flu was a global outbreak of influenza that originated in China in July 1968 and lasted until 1969–70 and infected more than 15% of the US population (&gt;30 million HK flu cases). No lockdowns anywhere! Hardly even discussed in the media. Compare that to Covid-19. Even if you believe the highly upwardly biased numbers for C19: 0.5 million C19 deaths...<br>

                Key Points Question Among patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), is there an association between use of hydroxychloroquine, with or without azithromycin, and in-hospital mortality? Findings In a retrospective cohort study of 1438 patients hospitalized in metropolitan New York, compared with treatment with neither drug, the adjusted hazard ratio for in-hospital mortality for treatment with hydroxychloroquine alone was 1.08, for azithromycin alone was 0.56, and for combined hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin was 1.35. None of these...<br>

                Only 304 US prisoner deaths through May 6, although prisoners locked up
like sardines!

2.3 million US prisoners 80%+ C19 positive!!!

US prisoner death rate still ½ the US civilian unconstitutional lockdown
C19 death rate.

WHY AREN’T PRISONERS DYING LIKE CRAZY?

Because C19 doesn’t kill young and healthy without pre-existing risks
and comorbidities.

Lockdowns don’t work.

Politicians and medical experts assert that: 1) COVID-19 is lethal to many beyond those that typically succumb to pneumonia in flu season (typically up to 60,000 in the United States annually; and 2) COVID-19 is still slowly spreading in major industrialized countries, implying there is still some potential benefit to the enormously costly social distancing and economic shutdown measures.

                Dear Dr, I keep reading your great post, but I keep worrying for me and

How do we contradict the mandatory vaccine narrative, that we can see
coming?

Excellent question! We need to convince the public that this is totally
unnecessary! Why would you ever vaccinate against such a non-lethal
virus? It’s like vaccinating against saline solution.

And as I’ve been saying for months, C19 was all over the globe in 2019.
This is yet another set of data proving that it was in the US
(Washington State) long before it was officially recognized. Probably 3
times as many “C19” deaths before it was even recognized in WA than when
they started keeping official reports. The lockdowns begun in March were
utterly useless.

about the effects of lockdowns on young Americans who saw their lives go
down the toilet! 41 million Americans have nothing to look forward to
but welfare checks and lockdowns! Of course the frustrations will boil

                Why are we not taking care of the people in nursing homes who need
isolation, since they are 150 times more likely to die with C19?

Locking down schools when only 51 people under age 25 have died from
C19? And nearly all US prisoners are C19 positive, but are young and
healthy and die at 1/2 the US rate (which is nursing home deaths to a
large extent).

                Anyone who actually wants to know what’s happening to the US C19
epidemic as opposed to all the fake news and exaggerated reporting needs
to watch this website regularly.

It is already showing that the C19 spike in April was actually excess
deaths that were offset in May. This will become clearer over time!

                The alarmists are going crazy because this week Sweden’s C19 ICU count went up by 4 patients on 5-18-20! No lockdowns, so they are done with this epidemic. The level of immunogenicity in the Swedish population is healthy because they’ve been social mixing all along. How is your immunogenicity after 2 months of living in a dark socially isolated cave?

So how does C19 give 35% of patients no symptoms? Because, as I’ve been saying all along, the virus was fully saturated in the global population months ago

The real tragedy: kids did not have to suffer food insecurity and
starvation. Or the attendant struggles by the powerless to get food from
those with power. “Oh government will take care of that!” The same
government that told us C19 transmissions would be zero by May! WE JUST
TOPPED 100,000 US C19 REPORTED DEATHS.

                NBA athletes, crammed together like sardines until they stopped playing
on March 11,2020.

So there have been two months since they self-isolated. Plenty of time
to develop C19 symptoms.

Looks like no athletes have dropped dead yet. And no one in their
families has either.

Why can’t we watch the NBA or any sports played by people under age 55
and healthy? They have a higher risk driving to the stadium for 2
months.

                Remember the 1st Amendment to the US Constitution? Isn’t that a SIC joke? “no law… abridging the right of the people peaceably to assemble…” When does this fake emergency bow to the US Constitution rather than following the whims of the irresponsible alarmists who are claiming authority. Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press; or the...<br>

                Another huge embarrassment for the Imperial College London C19 Model “the R” is notoriously difficult to pin down and the UK has not been issuing estimates. But Imperial also applied its UK assumptions to Sweden, warning that its rejection of lockdown was likely to leave the virus rampant with an R of between 3 and 4. That is to say: every person infected would give it to three or four others. Its modelling envisaged Sweden...<br>

                </li>
                Swedish pediatric deaths are still zero despite no lockdowns or school
closings! The Swedish deaths, like everywhere are overwhelmingly in the
frail elderly with immune senescence.

                Here is likely a main cause of the excessive deaths associated with C19
in NYC, Italy and Spain. Ventilators are not the right medicine for
these patients. Yet again, MD ignorance is killing people everywhere.

                An undisputed causal relationship: Lockdowns cause domestic violence.
Why aren’t kids back in schools? Zero pediatric deaths in Sweden,
schools never shut there.

How many smoking guns do we need to tell the idiots in charge that C19
was global months and months before the idiotic lockdowns!
I’ve been saying this from Day 1! Mathematical proof of it at joelhay.com

                If anyone thinks that lockdowns are meaningful in a country like Bangladesh, they are very naive. Nevertheless, Bangladesh released its lockdowns of many vital apparel factories 2 weeks ago! Did they get millions of new cases and deaths? No! Bangladeshi C19 death rate is 1/20 the US reported rate! 161 milliion Bangladeshis living in some of the most crowded conditions in the world. Only 228 deaths through May10! Even safer than US prisons! There is...<br>

                </li>
                As I’ve pointed out many times, lockdowns are supposed to prevent cases,
not deaths. And yet daily cases keep climbing around the world while
deaths keep dropping. This is just the natural biology of the SARS-Cov-2
virus. Proving yet again that lockdowns are utterly useless and silly.
