                What specific pathology does C19 cause? {#h.q3p78573ucmo .zfr3Q .JYVBee dir=”ltr” style=”text-align: center;”} Here’s the fundamental question that no one seems to have asked; what is the mechanism of action whereby C19 attacks the body and kills people?

                Lockdown Deaths {#h.vnyidqm5nueu .zfr3Q .JYVBee dir=”ltr” style=”text-align: center;”} I’m still projecting more than 100 lockdown deaths for every C19 death avoided through lockdowns!

                People are testing positive without even completing a test!



How do the alarmist idiots deal with a total collapse of the C19 testing data systems. Many people are testing positive without even completing a test!!!!!

Concerns arise as some receive positive COVID-19 results but never got tested

If so many people have been incorrectly identified as positive in the state’s system so easily, how accurate are the numbers that are released daily?

Look at Caifornia, Texas and Florida.

Repeat after me: Don’t look at C19 cases (most are totally
asymptomatic). FLORIDA ALL CAUSE DEATHS PLUMMETED IN JULY!!! Normally
the NY Times and social media would be all over a good news story like
all-cause deaths down 60%!

Only 304 US prisoner deaths through May 6, although prisoners locked up
like sardines!

2.3 million US prisoners 80%+ C19 positive!!!

US prisoner death rate still ½ the US civilian unconstitutional lockdown
C19 death rate.

\

WHY AREN’T PRISONERS DYING LIKE CRAZY?

\

Because C19 doesn’t kill young and healthy without pre-existing risks
and comorbidities.

Lockdowns don’t work.

Based upon my education and experience, it is my professional opinion
that 14-day quarantines are ineffective because there is no emergency in
Hawaii or the United States.

I declare under penalty of perjury under the laws of the United States,
that the foregoing is true and correct.

Isn’t Ventura County supposed to be a bit more racially sensitive than
telling Hispanics that 6 feet equals three boxes of picked vegetables
while telling whites it’s a ski length?

Anyone who actually wants to know what’s happening to the US C19
epidemic as opposed to all the fake news and exaggerated reporting needs
to watch this website regularly.

It is already showing that the C19 spike in April was actually excess
deaths that were offset in May. This will become clearer over time!

has had its kids in school all along, with zero deaths among boys and
girls under age 20! And they are fully exposed and able to neutralize

As Mike Fumento and I recall from his days as an AIDS fear-monger and
alarmist, Fauci’s track record was horrible even before he messed up the
C19 response! Why wasn’t he fired decades ago?

                The alarmists are going crazy



The alarmists are going crazy because this week Sweden’s C19 ICU count
went up by 4 patients on 5-18-20! No lockdowns, so they are done with
this epidemic. The level of immunogenicity in the Swedish population is
healthy because they’ve been social mixing all along. How is your
immunogenicity after 2 months of living in a dark socially isolated
cave?

Ironic to see Redfield, Faucci and other top White House medical brass
in quarantine! Contact tracing and quarantines don’t work with C19. Ask
the Swedes, Bangladeshis, Indians or US prisoners.

On
joelhay.com
I’ve been saying that from Day One of the C19 pandemic (first 100 cases
or 10 deaths) that it was EVERYWHERE!!!! The globe was SEROSATURATED!!!!

Now we’re back to March, 2019 with C19 guys!

What good is a lockdown of a fastmoving airborne virus (novel at that)
an entire year after the virus?????

Where’s the evidence that masks work? Particularly after 3 weeks when
they’ve been worn by poor people who lost their jobs and need the mask
to get food for their families?

Show me any scientific evidence that masks work for C19 in the real
world.

                Italy sewage study suggests COVID-19 was there in December 2019

How many smoking guns do we need to tell the idiots in charge that C19
was global months and months before the idiotic lockdowns!
I’ve been saying this from Day 1! Mathematical proof of it at joelhay.com

                </li>
                If anyone thinks that lockdowns are meaningful in a country like Bangladesh, they are very naive. Nevertheless, Bangladesh released its lockdowns of many vital apparel factories 2 weeks ago! Did they get millions of new cases and deaths? No! Bangladeshi C19 death rate is 1/20 the US reported rate! 161 milliion Bangladeshis living in some of the most crowded conditions in the world. Only 228 deaths through May10! Even safer than US prisons! There is...<br>

                </li>
                As I’ve pointed out many times, lockdowns are supposed to prevent cases,
not deaths. And yet daily cases keep climbing around the world while
deaths keep dropping. This is just the natural biology of the SARS-Cov-2
virus. Proving yet again that lockdowns are utterly useless and silly.
