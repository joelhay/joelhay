- Added TAGS functionality. Test buttons now appear on "All Pages." I added some code in main.scss and main.js to implement it.
- To change banner height, go to _header.scss in _sass/layout and alter the .wrapper-header margin-top attribute. Next, go to assets/css/main.scss. Change the height attribute of #banner-content. 
- To make post title clickable (directs to an article), simply add a 'link:' attribute to the front matter
