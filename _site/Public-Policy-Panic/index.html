    <p>The Washington Times: Public policy panic about the COVID-19 pandemic not supported by the facts.</p>

<p>Published March 26th</p>

<p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2020/mar/26/public-policy-panic-about-the-covid-19-pandemic-no/">Click for article</a></p>

<p>Politicians and medical experts assert that: 1) COVID-19 is lethal to many beyond those that typically succumb to pneumonia in flu season (typically up to 60,000 in the United States annually; and 2) COVID-19 is still slowly spreading in major industrialized countries, implying there is still some potential benefit to the enormously costly social distancing and economic shutdown measures.</p>

<p>What if they are wrong? What if COVID-19 isn’t significantly deadlier than regular flu? What if COVID-19 has already spread everywhere possible? Are we engaged in the most expensive public health intervention in history without any possible payback?</p>
