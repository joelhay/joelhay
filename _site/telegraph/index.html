    <p>The Telegraph - Why have so many coronavirus patients died in Italy?</p>

<p>There is clear evidence of massive Italian C19 death inflation:
This will affect our peak level forecasts but not our inflection point estimates.</p>

<p>Again, this will change the reporting levels relative to Asia, but probably won’t change the dynamics of the Italian epidemic very much. Compared to Asia and other EU counties (e.g. Sweden and Norway) the death overcount in Italy may be 8-fold:</p>

<p>But Prof Ricciardi added that Italy’s death rate may also appear high because of how doctors record fatalities. 
“The way in which we code deaths in our country is very generous in the sense that all the people who die in hospitals with the coronavirus are deemed to be dying of the coronavirus.
“On re-evaluation by the National Institute of Health, only 12 per cent of death certificates have shown a direct causality from coronavirus, while 88 per cent of patients who have died have at least one pre-morbidity - many had two or three,” he says.</p>
