title: Swedish Intensive Care Information
description: Here you can follow the development for patients who have so far been cared for in intensive care units with Covid-19 due to the coronavirus. All figures are taken from the Swedish Intensive Care Registry but have been compiled by SVT. Only the number in the top card shows the current situation - the others do not show how many are in intensive care right now - but how many have so far been enrolled in intensive care due to Covid-19.
