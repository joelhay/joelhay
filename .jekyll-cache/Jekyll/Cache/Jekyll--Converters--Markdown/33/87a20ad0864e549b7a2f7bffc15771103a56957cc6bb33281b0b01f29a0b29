<p>If anyone thinks that lockdowns are meaningful in a country like
Bangladesh, they are very naive. Nevertheless, Bangladesh released its
lockdowns of many vital apparel factories 2 weeks ago! Did they get
millions of new cases and deaths?</p>

<p>No! Bangladeshi C19 death rate is 1/20 the US reported rate! 161
milliion Bangladeshis living in some of the most crowded conditions in
the world. Only 228 deaths through May10! Even safer than US prisons!</p>

<p>There is no evidence in extremely dense countries that can NEVER do real
lockdowns like Bangladesh and India that millions are dying from C19 â€“
and they never will. Lockdowns were always meaningless when you can
reach out your window and touch your neighbors!</p>
