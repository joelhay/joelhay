<p>How do the alarmist idiots deal with a total collapse of the C19 testing data systems. Many people are testing positive without even completing a test!!!!!</p>

<p>Concerns arise as some receive positive COVID-19 results but never got tested</p>

<p>If so many people have been incorrectly identified as positive in the stateâ€™s system so easily, how accurate are the numbers that are released daily?</p>
