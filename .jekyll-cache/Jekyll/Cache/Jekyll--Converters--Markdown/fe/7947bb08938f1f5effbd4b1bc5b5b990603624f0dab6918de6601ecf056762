I"Ó<p>Iâ€™m still projecting more than 100 lockdown deaths for every C19 death
avoided through lockdowns! Anyone could have foreseen that the economic
and health consequences of the lockdowns were going to be severe and
fatal.</p>

<p>The worst thing about the Ferguson ICL model and the Gates/IHME model is
not that they missed the actual impacts by literally orders of
magnitude, but that they considered NONE of the costs of the lockdown
and social isolation policies. And they were clueless about the effects
of these lockdowns, because there was no evidence to show they worked.
Still is no evidence that lockdowns work! Go to <a href="joelhay.com">joelhay.com</a>
for the math proof.</p>

<p>Viscount Ridley: â€˜Uppsala University took the Imperial College model â€“
or one of them â€“ and adapted it to Sweden and forecasted deaths in
Sweden of over 90,000 by the end of May if there was no lockdown and
40,000 if a full lockdown was inforced. In fact, there have only been
4,350 deaths in Sweden until the end of May. This does seem to be a huge
discrepancy and suggests there was something wrong with the modelâ€¦â€™</p>
