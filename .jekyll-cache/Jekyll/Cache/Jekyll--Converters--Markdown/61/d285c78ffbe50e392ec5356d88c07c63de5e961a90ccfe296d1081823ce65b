<p>And all of New York State is experiencing a 60% reduction in all-cause
deaths in July, just like CA, TX, FL. And yet I’m still quarantined from
visiting my friends in NY?</p>

<p>Cases doesn’t equal excess mortality!</p>

<p>Here are all the iatrogenic* deaths in New York City caused by panicked
health care workers. Happy to show you the smuggled video by front line
nurses in Bronx and Brooklyn as they killed people by shoving
ventillators down their throats. But the New York Times will never tell
the good news that all cause mortality is below the five year trend in
July, just like in the rest of the USA.</p>

<p>*relating to illness caused by medical examination or treatment. (Think
ventilators or experimental drugs)</p>
