I"Ý<p>Why are we not taking care of the people in nursing homes who need
isolation, since they are 150 times more likely to die with C19?</p>

<p>Locking down schools when only 51 people under age 25 have died from
C19? And nearly all US prisoners are C19 positive, but are young and
healthy and die at 1/2 the US rate (which is nursing home deaths to a
large extent).</p>
