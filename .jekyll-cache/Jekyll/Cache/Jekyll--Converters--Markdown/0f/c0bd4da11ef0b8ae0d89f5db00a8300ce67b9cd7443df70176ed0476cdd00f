<p>Letâ€™s compare C19 vs the Hong Kong flu pandemic which had 1-4 million
deaths.</p>

<p>\</p>

<p>HK flu was a global outbreak of influenza that originated in China in
July 1968 and lasted until 1969â€“70 and infected more than 15% of the US
population (&gt;30 million HK flu cases). No lockdowns anywhere! Hardly
even discussed in the media.</p>

<p>Compare that to Covid-19.</p>

<p>Even if you believe the highly upwardly biased numbers for C19:</p>

<p>0.5 million C19 deaths vs 1-4 million HK flu deaths</p>

<p>2.3 million C19 cases vs 30+million HK flu cases.</p>

<p>And the reality is that CDC Excess Deaths are net negative despite C19!</p>

<p>Does anyone see any overreaction here?</p>
