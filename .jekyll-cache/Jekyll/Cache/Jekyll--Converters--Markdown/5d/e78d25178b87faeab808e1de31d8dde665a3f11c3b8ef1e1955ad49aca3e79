I"ç<p>It is actually the NPR reporters on this story that have intellectual disabilities. We call this C19 Derangement Syndrome.</p>

<p>While telling us that those in group living for intellectual disabilities have among the very highest C19 death rates, ostensibly because theyâ€™re packed together like sardines, and canâ€™t socially distance, NPR blithely ignores the fact that out of 2.3 million US prisoners, who are also packed together like sardines and are 90%+ postive for C19, there have been only 496 C19 deaths thus far! 1/2 the death rate of the unconstitutionally locked down civilians!</p>

<p>If C19 kills relatively more of one group of densely packed institutional residents because they canâ€™t social distance, why doesnâ€™t it kill all of them? No one is more densely packed than prisoners!</p>
