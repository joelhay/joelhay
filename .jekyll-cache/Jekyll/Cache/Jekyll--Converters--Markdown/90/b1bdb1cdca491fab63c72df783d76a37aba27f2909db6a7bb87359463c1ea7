<p>Politicians and medical experts assert that: 1) COVID-19 is lethal to many beyond those that typically succumb to pneumonia in flu season (typically up to 60,000 in the United States annually; and 2) COVID-19 is still slowly spreading in major industrialized countries, implying there is still some potential benefit to the enormously costly social distancing and economic shutdown measures.</p>

<p>What if they are wrong? What if COVID-19 isnâ€™t significantly deadlier than regular flu? What if COVID-19 has already spread everywhere possible? Are we engaged in the most expensive public health intervention in history without any possible payback?</p>
