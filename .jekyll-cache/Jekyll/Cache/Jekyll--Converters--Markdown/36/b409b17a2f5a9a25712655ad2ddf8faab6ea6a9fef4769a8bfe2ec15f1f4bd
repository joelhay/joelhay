I"o<p>The death rate for people infected with the new coronavirus may be as
low as 0.25% — far lower than the mortality rates of 2-4% or even higher
cited in the early days of the pandemic.</p>

<p>Dr. Donald Yealy based it partly on studies of levels of coronavirus
antibodies detected in people in New York and California, and partly on
COVID-19 deaths in the Pittsburgh region. The studies found that 5-20%
of people had been exposed to the coronavirus, with many noticing only
mild illness or none at all, he said.</p>

<p>“We’ve learned that way more people, far, far more people have actually
been exposed to the infection without any knowledge of it. That makes
the overall death rate much lower,” said Yealy, who is UPMC’s chair of
emergency medicine. “Many people just didn’t feel sick at all and
recovered without difficulty.”</p>

<p>This would mean 0.25 percent of people exposed to the coronavirus had
died, he said.</p>

<p>“There is a big difference between 0.25% mortality and 7%,” Yealy said.</p>
