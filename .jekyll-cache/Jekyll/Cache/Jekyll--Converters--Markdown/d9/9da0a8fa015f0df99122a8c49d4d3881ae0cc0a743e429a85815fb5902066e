I":<p>For the average American under age 55 the death risk from C19 is less
that the risk of dying from commuting to work for 4 weeks! For those
55-64 the death risk from C19 is about the same as commuting to work for
two months. Iâ€™ll bet any of the 30 million Americans just thrown out of
work by the lockdowns would take that risk in a heartbeat if they could
have their job!</p>

<p>So far according to the CDC there have been only 9 C19 deaths reported
in the whole country under the age of 25. Yet schools and colleges still
shut.</p>

<p>Let the young and healthy practice herd immunity! It works in Sweden and
even in US prisons.</p>
