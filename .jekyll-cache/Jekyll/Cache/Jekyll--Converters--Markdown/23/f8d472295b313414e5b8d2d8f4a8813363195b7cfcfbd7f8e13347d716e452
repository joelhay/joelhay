<p>So all the idiots who have been ragging on the courageous people of
Sweden can now officially pull their heads out of their dark holes.
Sweden is at total herd immunity, with 2-3 cases of C19 ICU admissions
daily (probably false positives) while you alarmist idiots are
struggling with maybe never ending your stupid lockdowns. And yet as Roy
and I showed in the last post‚Äî-SWEDEN IS OVER C19</p>

<p>\</p>

<p>But you are not because of your idiot politicians.</p>
