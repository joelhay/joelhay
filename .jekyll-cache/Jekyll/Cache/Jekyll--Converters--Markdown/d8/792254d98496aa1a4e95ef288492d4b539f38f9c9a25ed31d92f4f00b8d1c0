<p>Robert makes excellent points! These models were based on zero evidence
about the spread of C19. And yet they locked us down because they were
impressed by equations and Greek symbols. Nothing in any of these models
about the effects of lockdowns on young Americans who saw their lives go
down the toilet! 41 million Americans have nothing to look forward to
but welfare checks and lockdowns! Of course the frustrations will boil
over!</p>
