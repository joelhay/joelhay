<p>Noted this para on p 9:</p>

<p>“In contrast to the direct impact of COVID-19, the broader effects of
the pandemic on child health are significant. Reduced household income
will force poor families to cut back on essential health and food
expenditures. Drawing again on the forecast for global economic growth
from the IMF and the historical relationship between GDP growth and
infant mortality in the developing world15 , hundreds of thousands of
additional child deaths could occur in 2020 compared to a pre-pandemic
counterfactual scenario. This would effectively reverse the last 2 to 3
years of progress in reducing infant mortality within a single year.”</p>
