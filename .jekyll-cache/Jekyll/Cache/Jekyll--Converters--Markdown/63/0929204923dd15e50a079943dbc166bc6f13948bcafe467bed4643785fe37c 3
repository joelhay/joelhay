I"ø<p>I think Peter Attia is on to something yet again! C19, immunosenescence, poor diet, exercise and STRESS! are all related to bad outcomes with C19 or any immune system challenge! They are also related to ALL chronic
diseases including cancers, circulatory, diabetes, muscle/bone deterioration, etc.</p>

<p>So if you donâ€™t want to get sick in the long run, live fit and you also wonâ€™t get as sick in the short run (to reparaphrase JM Keynes, â€œIn the long run weâ€™re all deadâ€)!</p>

<p>BY THE WAY, you have to listen to Attia Podcast #85, it is mind-blowing!</p>
