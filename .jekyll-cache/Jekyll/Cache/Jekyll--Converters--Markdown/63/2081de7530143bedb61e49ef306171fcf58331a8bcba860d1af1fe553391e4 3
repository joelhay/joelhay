I"+<p>Where is any evidence that SICs work when they are started 2 weeks into
the C19 PCR+ case reporting? We know that by March 3, 2020, which is the
day that the US hit 100 PCR+ cases, there had to be many many people
already exposed and successfully suppressing virus. The asymptomatic
transmission had already occured in every state!</p>

<p>What are the justificaitons for SICs? All of it is post hoc
justification. There is NO EVIDENCE that SICs work, particularly when
implemented 2 weeks into the actual C19 PCR+ epidemic of sick and frail
people reporting to ICUs. By then the cat is out of the bag.</p>

<p>And by the way, since Tigers can get C19, what about cats? Do we need to
lock down all house pets?</p>

<p>The antibody tests will answer that question in Santa Clara County in a
couple weeks.</p>
