				<p>Because 1) COVID-19 was present everywhere long before the lockdowns, 2) although antibody tests are imperfect, they will show that the prevalence was the same in late 2019 as it is today.</p>

					<h3>WHY CONTACT TRACING DOESNâ€™T WORK</h3>

				<p>Because 1) the virus is very contagious and everywhere already, 2) contact tracing is disruptive to peopleâ€™s lives and can lead to discriminatory practices, and 3) it is unknown how to use any such contact tracing data to reduce C19 transmission risk.</p>

					<h3>WHAT SHOULD WE DO?</h3>
				</header>
				<p>Maintain infection precaution measures for high-risk individuals (e.g. nursing home residents, immunocompromised, elderly with comorbidities), including appropriate PPE, handwashing, and avoidance of large groups.
                Reopen all schools, colleges and universities as quickly as possible.  As of May 1, 2020, only 9 children under the age of 15 and only 50 under the age of 25 were reported to have died in the US.
                Allow any and all businesses to open completely if they are willing to do so and decide what social distancing measures they would like to implement.</p>
                <p style="text-align: center;">Relax and use common sense.  Panic doesnâ€™t help</p>
