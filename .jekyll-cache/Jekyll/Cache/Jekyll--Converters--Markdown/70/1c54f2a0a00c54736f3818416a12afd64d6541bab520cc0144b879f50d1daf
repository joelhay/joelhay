<p>If you have a condition or disability that prevents you from wearing a
face mask/covering, you might be wondering about your rights.</p>

<p>California health officials announced June 18 that people are required
to wear masks in most public settings, but there are some exceptions.
Those with a medical condition, mental health condition, or disability
that prevents wearing a face covering are exempt, according to guidance
from the California Department of Public Health.</p>
