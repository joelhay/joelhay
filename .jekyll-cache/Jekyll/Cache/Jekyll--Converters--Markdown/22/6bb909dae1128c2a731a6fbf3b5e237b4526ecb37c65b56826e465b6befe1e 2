I"Ù<p>As Iâ€™ve been saying, with a rapid and completely novel virus, and daily
flights from Wuhan to LA, SF and Europe, the idea that this virus wasnâ€™t
everywhere back in November or even earlier is now impossible to defend.
Data are streaming in from Paris, Germany, LA, Santa Clara, etc. proving
global cases in November. This was everywhere in days!</p>

<p>As Iâ€™ve always said on <a href="joelhay.com">joelhay.com</a>, the lockdowns, if they even could have any effect, were utterly useless and silly when implemented in March 2020.</p>
