I"{<p>NBA athletes, crammed together like sardines until they stopped playing
on March 11,2020.</p>

<p>So there have been two months since they self-isolated. Plenty of time
to develop C19 symptoms.</p>

<p>Looks like no athletes have dropped dead yet. And no one in their
families has either.</p>

<p>Why canâ€™t we watch the NBA or any sports played by people under age 55
and healthy? They have a higher risk driving to the stadium for 2
months.</p>
