<p>If the COVID-19 pandemic tails off in a few weeks, months before the
alarmists claim it will, they will probably pivot immediately and pat
themselves on the back for the brilliant social-distancing controls that
they imposed on the world. They will claim that their heroic
recommendations averted total calamity. Unfortunately, they will be
wrong; and Sweden, which has done almost no mandated social distancing,
will probably prove them wrong.</p>

<p>Unlike other countries, Sweden has so far avoided both isolation and
economic ruin.</p>
