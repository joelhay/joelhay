I"<p>Dear Dr, I keep reading your great post, but I keep worrying for me and
my family about this new warp speed vaccine, that totally freaks me out.
How do we contradict the mandatory vaccine narrative, that we can see
coming?</p>

<p>Excellent question! We need to convince the public that this is totally
unnecessary! Why would you ever vaccinate against such a non-lethal
virus? Itâ€™s like vaccinating against saline solution.</p>
