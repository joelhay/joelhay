I"´<p>The WHO should definitely be defunded!</p>

<p>Why would they even be telling us that asymptomatics canâ€™t transmit C19? Locking down asymptomatics was the whole point of the lockdowns! So we went through this lockdown disaster and cratered the global economy for nothing?!!!!!</p>

<p>Not knowing whether asymptomatics can transmit C19 this many months into the pandemic, much less the lockdowns? Why donâ€™t the asymptomatics at the WHO cross-inject their colleagues with C19 and show that nothing
happens! If they donâ€™t want to use WHO officials as lab rats, they could even use lab rats!</p>

<p>Not knowing whether asymptomatics can transmit C19 would be like a major league batter not knowing 3 strikes and youâ€™re out! WHO canâ€™t even play whiffleball!</p>
