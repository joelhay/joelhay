I"ª<p>â€œC19 derangement syndromeâ€ is a real phenomenon. It is a deadly combination of a modest virus and a hysterical public health establishment. It takes over the brainâ€™s logic circuits, so that evidence and logic cease to work properly.</p>

<p>How does anyone with functioning brain cells think that the United States, with 4.25% of the world population but has almost 1/3 of the C19 deaths! What an unlucky country to be in! Except for the prisons, where the C19 death rate is half the rate for the civilian lockdown population.</p>
