<p>Turns out that the IHME model had far deeper problems than incomplete information. When fitting those curves, it operated under an assumption that states’ curves would generally be symmetrical — that deaths would
fall as quickly as they had risen. There is no reason this has to be the case, and indeed, imposing a specific shape like this undermines the entire point of drawing on other places’ experiences to see where we could end up.</p>

<p>Another problem was it simply didn’t work. It wasn’t and isn’t some conspiracy to over- or under-predict the toll of COVID-19; it just has not been very accurate. The model was failing to make even the shortest-term predictions accurately at the state level. Its guesses were so far off that even its “95 percent” intervals didn’t include the correct value 70 percent of the time. The group updated its paper a few weeks later, finding that the predictions were no better in later versions of the model. National-level predictions weren’t quite that bad, but ticked down to about 60,000. We’re already at 75,000 today.</p>
