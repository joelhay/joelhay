I"<p>You may think that lockdowns are inconvenient. In most of the rest of
the world LOCKDOWNS ARE KILLING PEOPLE!</p>

<p>Joel: just saw your interview on KUSI and visited your website. Thanks
so much for speaking out against the media fueled, panic-laden, lockdown
mantra, which is destroying people! Take a look as this video of a 4
kilometer line in South Africa for food - at the end of line, they get 1
bag. Tragic!</p>
