<p>While no possibility can be eliminated at this early stage of the
outbreak, they say that there are more likely explanations for a
positive diagnostic test coming after a negative test. The tests used to
diagnose Covid-19 look for snippets of the virusâ€™ genome, its RNA. But
what they canâ€™t tell you is if what theyâ€™re finding is evidence of
â€œliveâ€ virus, meaning infectious virus. Once a person fights off a
virus, viral particles tend to linger for some time. These cannot cause
infections, but they can trigger a positive test. The levels of these
particles can fluctuate, which explains how a test could come back
positive after a negative test. But it does not mean the virus has
become active, or infectious, again. The diagnostic tests typically rely
on patient samples from nasal passages. Collecting that specimen is not
foolproof. If that patient then gets another test, it might accurately
show they have the virus. As Jana Broadhurst, the director of the
Nebraska Biocontainment Unitâ€™s clinical laboratory, said, â€œgarbage in,
garbage out.â€</p>
