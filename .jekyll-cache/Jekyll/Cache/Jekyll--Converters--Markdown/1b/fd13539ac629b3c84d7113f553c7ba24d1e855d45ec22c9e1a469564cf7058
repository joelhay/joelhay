I"]	<p>The IHME Model is complete garbage!</p>

<p>Turns out that the IHME model had far deeper problems than incomplete
information. When fitting those curves, it operated under an assumption
that states’ curves would generally be symmetrical — that deaths would
fall as quickly as they had risen. There is no reason this has to be the
case, and indeed, imposing a specific shape like this undermines the
entire point of drawing on other places’ experiences to see where we
could end up.</p>

<p>Another problem was it simply didn’t work. It wasn’t and isn’t some
conspiracy to over- or under-predict the toll of COVID-19; it just has
not been very accurate. The model was failing to make even the
shortest-term predictions accurately at the state level. Its guesses
were so far off that even its “95 percent” intervals didn’t include the
correct value 70 percent of the time. The group updated its paper a few
weeks later, finding that the predictions were no better in later
versions of the model. National-level predictions weren’t quite that
bad, but ticked down to about 60,000. We’re already at 75,000 today.</p>
