since February! This virus has an R of 6. It was everywhere in the globe
by December, 2019.</p>

<p>‚ÄúA recent paper (Gomes et al.[7]) provides the answer. Variation in
their susceptibility to infection and propensity to infect others can
cause the HIT to be much lower than it is in a homogeneous population.
Standard simple compartmental epidemic models take no account of such
variability. And the model used in the Ferguson20 study, while much more
complex, appears only to take into account inhomogeneity arising from a
geographic separation from other individuals and household size ‚Äì with
only a modest resulting impact on the growth of the epidemic.[8] Using a
compartmental model modified to take such variability into account, with
co-variability between susceptibility and infectivity arguably handled
in a more realistic way than by Gomes et al., The HIT is reached at a
much lower level than when the population is homogeneous. That would
explain why the HIT appears to have been passed in Stockholm by mid
April. The same seems likely to be the case in other major cities and
regions that have been badly affected by COVID-19.‚Äù</p>
