I"<p>Only 304 US prisoner deaths through May 6, although prisoners locked up
like sardines!</p>

<p>2.3 million US prisoners 80%+ C19 positive!!!</p>

<p>US prisoner death rate still ½ the US civilian unconstitutional lockdown
C19 death rate.</p>

<p>WHY AREN’T PRISONERS DYING LIKE CRAZY?</p>

<p>Because C19 doesn’t kill young and healthy without pre-existing risks
and comorbidities.</p>

<p>Lockdowns don’t work.</p>
