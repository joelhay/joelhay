I"®<p>John Fund has found another excellent case exampleâ€“Hong Kong Flu of 1968, so far much worse than C19â€“ where social isolation controls were not even contemplated. A lot happened in 1968, I was there. Even 130,000 extra US flu deaths did not shut schools, businesses, or force people to socially isolate. No one wore masks. It was not in the top news stories of 1968 with the MLK and RFK assassinations, the riots, the Chicago convention, presidential election, Vietnam, summer of love, etc.</p>
