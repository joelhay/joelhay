<p>Only 17% of the patients were working, compared with 37% who were retired and 46% who were unemployed, the survey said. Sixty-six percent of patients said they were at home before they were admitted to the hospital, compared with 18% who had been in nursing homes, 4% from assisted-living facilities and less than 1% from prisons.</p>

<p>“This is a surprise,” Mr. Cuomo said. “We were thinking that maybe we were going to find a higher percentage of essential employees who were getting sick because they were going to work—that these may be nurses, doctors, transit workers. That’s not the case, and they were predominately at home.”</p>
