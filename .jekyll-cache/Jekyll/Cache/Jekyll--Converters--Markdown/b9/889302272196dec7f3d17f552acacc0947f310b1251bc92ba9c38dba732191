<p>The Washington Times: Public policy panic about the COVID-19 pandemic
not supported by the facts.</p>

<p>Politicians and medical experts assert that: 1) COVID-19 is lethal to
many beyond those that typically succumb to pneumonia in flu season
(typically up to 60,000 in the United States annually; and 2) COVID-19
is still slowly spreading in major industrialized countries, implying
there is still some potential benefit to the enormously costly social
distancing and economic shutdown measures.</p>

<p>What if they are wrong? What if COVID-19 isn’t significantly deadlier
than regular flu? What if COVID-19 has already spread everywhere
possible? Are we engaged in the most expensive public health
intervention in history without any possible payback?</p>
