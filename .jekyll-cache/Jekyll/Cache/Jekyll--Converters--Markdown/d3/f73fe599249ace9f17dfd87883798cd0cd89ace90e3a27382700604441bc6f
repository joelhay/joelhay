<p>Good to be in Prof. Ioannidis company on this.</p>

<p>It was clear in February that C19 isnâ€™t worse than typical flu.</p>

<p>\</p>

<p>Consider John Ioannidis, a professor at Stanfordâ€™s School of Medicine.
He juggles appointments in statistics, biomedical data, prevention
research and health research and policy. Google Scholar ranks him among
the worldâ€™s 100 most-cited scientists. Yet heâ€™s now found himself
pilloried because he dissents from the theories behind the
lockdownsâ€”because heâ€™s looked at the data and found good news.</p>

<p>In a March article for Stat News, Dr. Ioannidis argued that Covid-19 is
far less deadly than modelers were assuming. He considered the
experience of the Diamond Princess cruise ship, which was quarantined
Feb. 4 in Japan. Nine of 700 infected passengers and crew died. Based on
the demographics of the shipâ€™s population, Dr. Ioannidis estimated that
the U.S. fatality rate could be as low as 0.025% to 0.625% and put the
upper bound at 0.05% to 1%â€”comparable to that of seasonal flu.</p>

<p>â€œIf that is the true rate,â€ he wrote, â€œlocking down the world with
potentially tremendous social and financial consequences may be totally
irrational.</p>
