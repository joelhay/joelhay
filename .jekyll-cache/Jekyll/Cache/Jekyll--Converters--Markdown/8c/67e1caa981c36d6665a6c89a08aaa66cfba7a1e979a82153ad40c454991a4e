up</a></p>

<p>â€œThe researchers found that the percentage of infections was indeed
vastly larger than the roughly 1,000 known positive cases in the county
at the time of the studyâ€¦. 50 to 85 times as high as the number of
known cases.</p>

<p>the large majority of people who contract Covid-19 recover without ever
knowing they were infected, and that the U.S. infection fatality rate
may be more than an order of magnitude lower than authorities had
assumed. â€¦ true infection fatality rate is somewhere in the range of
0.12% to 0.2%â€”far closer to seasonal influenza.</p>

<p>A study published in the New England Journal of Medicine examined 215
women entering two hospitals to give birth between March 22 and April 4.
These patients had a Covid-19 infection rate over 15%. Of expectant
mothers who tested positive for active infections, 88% were asymptomatic
at the time of admission. â€¦ infection rate 10 times the rate of known
cases in the city as a whole as of April 17â€”and New Yorkers have been
tested for Covid-19 far more extensively than residents of other
states.â€</p>
