I"È<p>Here is the key pg 3 paragraph from the IHME/Gates modeling paper for
why we‚Äôre all in lockdown. Notice that there is NOT ONE REFERENCE TO
SUPPORT SOCIAL DISTANCING??</p>

<p>And notice that the ‚Äútreatment effects‚Äù of social isolation controls
(SICs) is totally arbitrary?</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>They say do one SIC you get a 33% reduction</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>do two SICs you get a 67% reduction</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>do 3-4 SICs you get a 100% reduction</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>We should have had zero C19 transmission by now and zero cases according
to this!</p>

<p>they say all SICs are interchangeable! School closures, restaurant, bar
and other ‚Äúnon-essential‚Äù business closures, stay at home lockdowns, and
transportation closures, ARE ALL IDENTICAL AND EQUIVALENT in their
effects on C19 transmission. I thought we have already done all four for
about 30 days? Why isn‚Äôt C19 transmission zero?</p>

<p>So we‚Äôre in lockdown based on ZERO EVIDENCE!!!</p>

<p>Not to mention that this model keeps changing daily. And they are
forecasting double the US deaths and a wider confidence interval than
they did before imposing SICs on the US!</p>

<p>I thought SICs were supposed to reduce cases and deaths, not increase
them!</p>
