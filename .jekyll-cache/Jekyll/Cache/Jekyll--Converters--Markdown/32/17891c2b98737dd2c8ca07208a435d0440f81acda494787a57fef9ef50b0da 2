<p>Isn‚Äôt that a SIC joke? ‚Äúno law‚Ä¶ abridging the right of the
people peaceably to assemble‚Ä¶‚Äù</p>

<p>When does this fake emergency bow to the US Constitution rather than
following the whims of the irresponsible alarmists who are claiming
authority.</p>

<p>Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or
prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or abridging the freedom of
speech, or of the press; or the right of the people peaceably to
assemble, and to petition the government for a redress of grievances.</p>
