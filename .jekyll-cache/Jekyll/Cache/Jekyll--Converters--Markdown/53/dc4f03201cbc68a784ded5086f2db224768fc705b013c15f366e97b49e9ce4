I"c<p>Now we are really in for it! We are going to have to mask and socially
distance every mammal on the planet! THEY ALL HAVE C19!!!!! According to
the alarmists, we can never come out until every living organism is
wearing a mask!</p>

<p>The official C19 summer silly season starts today!</p>

<p>Can everyone wake up and smell the coffee? When 56% of all the rodents
in Vietnam test positive for C19 but Vietnam has zero C19 deaths, what
does that tell you?</p>

<p>It tells you that the C19 lockdown alarmists have reached the stage of
mouth frothing, bubble-blowing, eye-bulging, cheek-popping total utter
psychosis, if they think that contact tracing or social isolation means
anything other than total BS!!!!! Are we going to ask people to
interview every rat in their house and see which other rats those rats
have been within 6 feet of? What about cats, bats and gnats also? Lions,
tigers and bears? The three little piggies?</p>
