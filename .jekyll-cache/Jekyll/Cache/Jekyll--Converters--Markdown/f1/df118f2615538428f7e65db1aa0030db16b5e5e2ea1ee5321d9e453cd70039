<p>The alarmists are going crazy because this week Swedenâ€™s C19 ICU count
went up by 4 patients on 5-18-20! No lockdowns, so they are done with
this epidemic. The level of immunogenicity in the Swedish population is
healthy because theyâ€™ve been social mixing all along. How is your
immunogenicity after 2 months of living in a dark socially isolated
cave?</p>
