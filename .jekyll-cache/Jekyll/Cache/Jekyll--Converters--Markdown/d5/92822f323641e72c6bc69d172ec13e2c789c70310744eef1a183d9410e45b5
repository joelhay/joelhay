I"¹<p>How about New Jersey?</p>

<p>Another state where health care workers, panicked by hysterical fear, killed thousands of mostly nursing home residents 2-8 weeks earlier than they would have died by shoving ventillators down their throats and other deadly medical errors (happy to provide video proof). Even Jersey is seeing the same 60% reduction in ALL CAUSE mortality in July as everywhere else in the USA.</p>

<p>Washington State Deaths are also down 60%!!!!</p>

<p>Be happy go out and celebrate outside!]WA is ALARMIST GROUND ZERO!!! Bill Gates, Washington State and the infamous stupid IHME model that locked us all down based on ZERO actual evidence. Guess what folks you can lock us up, but cases still skyrocket and deaths still plummet! Just like everywhere else in the USA.</p>

<p>OK; so letâ€™s keep doing the Alarmist states. Yes Illinois, cases are up, BUT DEATHS ARE WAY WAY DOWN. PCR tests are BS!! Be happy, deaths are down 60% in IL, just like in the rest of America. Why are you locked down in IL?</p>

<p>And in Georgia, where the Governor actually wants people to live, work and enjoy their lives the Alarmists are having fits because people arenâ€™t burying themselve under their beds.</p>

<p>But deaths are way down in GA! Be happy! They are down over 60% just like everywhere else. And now in July we are starting to see the blackpoints below the 5 year trends, not just the hollow points!</p>
