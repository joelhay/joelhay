I"<p>Like Sweden; South Dakota never locked down! and with only 21 deaths,
their death rate is 24 per millionâ€”ONE TENTH the US C19 mortality
rate.</p>

<p>Lockdowns donâ€™t work!!!</p>

<p>South Dakota Gov. Kristi Noem on Tuesday mapped out a plan for getting
the state â€œback to normal,â€ amid the coronavirus outbreak, a plan that
she said emphasizes personal responsibility instead of government
orders.</p>

<p>Later, the Republican governor â€“ who drew criticism from Democrats and
others for never issuing a statewide stay-at-home-order â€“ talked about
her plan â€œIn South Dakota we didnâ€™t close any businesses. We didnâ€™t do
any shelter-in-place.â€</p>
