<p>Question Among patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), is
there an association between use of hydroxychloroquine, with or without
azithromycin, and in-hospital mortality?</p>

<p>Findings In a retrospective cohort study of 1438 patients hospitalized
in metropolitan New York, compared with treatment with neither drug, the
adjusted hazard ratio for in-hospital mortality for treatment with
hydroxychloroquine alone was 1.08, for azithromycin alone was 0.56, and
for combined hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin was 1.35. None of these
hazard ratios were statistically significant.</p>

<p>Meaning Among patients hospitalized with COVID-19, treatment with
hydroxychloroquine, azithromycin, or both was not associated with
significantly lower in-hospital mortality.</p>
