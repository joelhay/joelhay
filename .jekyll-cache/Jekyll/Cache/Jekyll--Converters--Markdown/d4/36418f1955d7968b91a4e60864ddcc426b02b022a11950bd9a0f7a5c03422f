<p>The WHO should definitely be defunded!</p>

<p>\</p>

<p>Why would they even be telling us that asymptomatics can’t transmit C19?
Locking down asymptomatics was the whole point of the lockdowns! So we
went through this lockdown disaster and cratered the global economy for
nothing?!!!!!</p>

<p>\</p>

<p>Not knowing whether asymptomatics can transmit C19 this many months into
the pandemic, much less the lockdowns? Why don’t the asymptomatics at
the WHO cross-inject their colleagues with C19 and show that nothing
happens! If they don’t want to use WHO officials as lab rats, they could
even use lab rats!</p>

<p>\</p>

<p>Not knowing whether asymptomatics can transmit C19 would be like a major
league batter not knowing 3 strikes and you’re out! WHO can’t even play
whiffleball!</p>
