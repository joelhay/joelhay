I"¿<p>The death rate for people infected with the new coronavirus may be as
low as 0.25% â€” far lower than the mortality rates of 2-4% or even higher
cited in the early days of the pandemic.</p>

<p>Dr. Donald Yealy based it partly on studies of levels of coronavirus
antibodies detected in people in New York and California, and partly on
COVID-19 deaths in the Pittsburgh region. The studies found that 5-20%
of people had been exposed to the coronavirus, with many noticing only
mild illness or none at all, he said.</p>

<p>â€œWeâ€™ve learned that way more people, far, far more people have actually
been exposed to the infection without any knowledge of it. That makes
the overall death rate much lower,â€ said Yealy, who is UPMCâ€™s chair of
emergency medicine. â€œMany people just didnâ€™t feel sick at all and
recovered without difficulty.â€</p>

<p>This would mean 0.25 percent of people exposed to the coronavirus had
died, he said.</p>

<p>â€œThere is a big difference between 0.25% mortality and 7%,â€ Yealy said.</p>
