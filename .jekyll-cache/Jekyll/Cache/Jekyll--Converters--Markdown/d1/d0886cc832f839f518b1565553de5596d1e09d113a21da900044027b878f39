I"œ<p>Here are links to two very important articles about PCR testing.  The verdict - it sucks for Corona Testing.</p>

<p><a href="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/Eek36ABXstDfBVVgfP4NL1X0Zxf9KnQNDDZyhdeL8_QHlzB8X26hS06l4pxL3VbSK8bOlNYVlHdaZQwj7cAjpD9VXfUEPcOEa4OFQOymcOI1aIeD7Cwj=w1280">‚ÄúPCR basically takes a sample of your cells and amplifies any DNA to look for ‚Äòviral sequences‚Äô, i.e. bits of non-human DNA that seem to match parts of a known viral genome. The problem is the test is known not to work. It uses ‚Äòamplification‚Äô which means taking a very very tiny amount of DNA and growing it exponentially until it can be analysed. Obviously any minute contaminations in the sample will also be amplified leading to potentially gross errors of discovery. Additionally, it‚Äôs only looking for partial viral sequences, not whole genomes, so identifying a single pathogen is next to impossible even if you ignore the other issues.The idea these kits can isolate a specific virus like COVID-19 is nonsense.‚Äù</a></p>
